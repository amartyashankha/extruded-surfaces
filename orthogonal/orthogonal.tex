\section{Orthogonal Terrains}
\label{sec:orthogonal_terrains}

In this section, we outline a construction of orthogonal terrains with arbitrary rational extrusion heights.
In our construction, the cross section at will always be on the $x-z$ plane.
This makes the analysis much simpler.

To simplify the presentation, we will consider an uniform $X-Y$ grid,
with arbitrary rational extrusion heights corresponding to every grid square (Figure~\ref{fig:terrain}).
\begin{definition}
An $n\times m$ rational grid extrusion is a 3-dimensional structure,
whose projection onto the $x-y$ plane forms an unit grid of size $n\times m$.
In the 3-dimensional structure, the unit face corresponding to the location $(i.j)$,
exists at height $E_{i,j}$ (in the $z$ direction), where $E_{i,j}$ is a rational number.
\end{definition}
%In the case that $E_{i,j}$ is rational, we can simply scale down down our construction by an appropriate size, to obtain integer heights.

We consider each ''column'' of a given grid extrusion separately as an individual \emph{column extrusion}.
We will construct each of the $n$ columns independently (Figure~\ref{fig:level_shift}),
and attach them together with \emph{column connectors} (Figure~\ref{fig:column_connector}).

We begin by choosing an $2\varepsilon=1/K$ where $K$ is a positive integer.
This is chosen such that $E_{i,j}$ is an integral multiple of $2\varepsilon$ for all $i,j$.
Then we scale the entire construction up by a factor of $K$.

Given a strip of size $X\times T$, we will consider the evolution of a cross section of length $X$ evolving for time $T$.
%Imagine that there are $T = \frac Y\varepsilon$ time steps of length $\varepsilon$, over which the cross section evolves along the $y$-axis.
