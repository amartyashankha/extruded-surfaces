\section{Orthogonal Graphs}
\label{sec:orthogonal_graphs}

In this section, we outline a construction of orthogonal graphs with arbitrary rational extrusion heights.
In our construction, the cross section at will always be on the $x-z$ plane.
This makes the analysis much simpler.

\subsection{Grid Extrusion}
\label{sec:grid_extrusion}

To simplify the presentation, we will consider an uniform $X-Y$ grid,
with arbitrary rational extrusion heights corresponding to every grid square.
\begin{definition}
An $n\times m$ rational grid extrusion is a 3-dimensional structure,
whose projection onto the $x-y$ plane forms an unit grid of size $n\times m$.
Additionally, the unit face corresponding to the location $(i.j)$,
is extruded $E_{ij}$ units in the $z$ direction, where $E_{ij}$ is a rational number.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Strip Extrusion}
\label{sec:strip_extrusion}
We also consider each ''column'' of a given grid extrusion separately as an indivisual \emph{strip exrusion}.
We will construct each of the $n$ strips independently, and attachthem together with \emph{strip connectors}.
