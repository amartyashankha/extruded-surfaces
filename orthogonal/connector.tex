\subsection{Gluing Column Extrusions together with Strip Connectors}
\label{sec:strip_connectors}

Now that all the column extrusions $\left\{ \mathcal C^{(i)} \right\}$ have the same evolution time,
we would like to glue them together into a continuous strip of paper.
In order to achieve this, we consider the time-axis boundaries of $\mathcal C^{(i)}$
(red line in Figure~\ref{fig:level_shift}~\ref{fig:up_down}).

\end{wrapfigure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item During the horizontal evolution of any row $j$, both boundaries move along the positive $y$-axis with unit velocity
          (Figure~\ref{fig:level_shift0}~\ref{fig:level_shift3}~\ref{fig:level_shift4}~\ref{fig:up_down0}~\ref{fig:up_down4}~\ref{fig:up_down5}).
    \item During the vertical transition from row $j$ to $j+1$, both boundaries move back and forth along the $x$-axis with unit velocity.
          (Figure~\ref{fig:level_shift1}~\ref{fig:level_shift2}~\ref{fig:up_down1}~\ref{fig:up_down2}~\ref{fig:up_down3}).
          We can divide the vertial transition into $k = D_j/(2\epsilon)$ intervals of length $2\epsilon$.
          Each of these interval segments is either a up-shift, a down-shift, or a up-down gadget.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In the first half of each interval ($\epsilon$ time), the left and right boundaries move towards each other;
              i.e. the left boundary moves along the positive $x$-axis, and the right boundary moves along the negative $x$-axis for a distance of $\epsilon$.
        \item In the second half of each interval, the left and right reverse directions, and return to their original positions.
        \item After $D_j$ time, the boundaries return to their original positions, and resume their movement in the positive $y$ direction.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
