\section{Cross Sections}
\label{sec:cross_sections}

We introduce a new method of origami construction, using cross section disgrams.
Instead of beginning our construction from a 2-dimensional sheet of paper,
we consider a 1-dimensional cross section moving forwards in time.
A simple example is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:strip_narrowing}.

\section{Segments and Cross Sections}
\label{sec:segments_and_cross_sections}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:segment}
A segment $s$ is an oriented line segment with left and right endpoints $\vec s_l$ and $\vec s_r$.
Each segment is also associated with an orientation vector $\vec{\hat o_s} \equiv\frac{\vec s_r-\vec s_l}{ \left\| \vec s_r-\vec s_l\right\|}$.
This vector serves to disambiguate the orientation of zero length segments.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:cross_section}
A cross section $C$ is defined as an ordered list of line segments $\langle s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n\rangle$,
such that for every segment $s_i$ (except the last),
the right endpoint of $s_i$ coincides with the left endpoint of $s_{i+1}$.
Each segment $s$ is also associated with a velocity vector $\vec{\hat v_s}$ of unit magnitude.
For a segment $s\in C$ we will also denote this velocity as $\vec{\hat v_i}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:node}
Given a cross section $C = \langle s_1, s_2,\cdots s_n \rangle$, a node $x$ denotes a point on one of the segments $s_i$.
A joint node is a node that resides on the endpoint of a segment.
The distance between two nodes on a cross section is defined as the overall length f cross section between the two nodes.

\end{definition}

\begin{restatable}{pro}{UniformVelocity}
\label{pro:uniform_velocity}
All nodes on a segment $s$ except the joint nodes move with the same velocity $\vec{\hat v_s}$.
\end{restatable}

\begin{restatable}{pro}{OrthogonalVelocity}
\label{pro:orthogonal_velocity}
The velocity $\vec{\hat v_s}$ of segment $s$ is orthogonal to its orientation $\vec{\hat o_s}$.
\end{restatable}
