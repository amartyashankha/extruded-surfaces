\section{Cross Sections}
\label{sec:cross_sections}

We introduce a new method of origami construction, using cross section disgrams.
Instead of beginning our construction from a 2-dimensional sheet of paper,
we consider a 1-dimensional cross section moving forwards in time.
A simple example is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:strip_narrowing}.

\begin{definition}
A cross section is defined as an ordered list of line segments $\langle s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n\rangle$,
such that for every segment $s_i$ (except the last),
the right endpoint of $s_i$ coincides with the left endpoint of $s_{i+1}$.
Each line segment is associated with a velocity vector $\vec v_i$ of unit magnitude.
Each segment is also associated with an unit orientation vector $\vec o_i$,
which is the unit vector from the left endpint to the right endpoint.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:uniform_velocity}
All points on a single segment move with the same velocity $v_i$.
\end{lemma}
