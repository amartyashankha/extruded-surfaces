\subsection{Joints}
\label{sec:joints}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:joints}
A cross section with $n$ segments is also associated with a list of joints
$ \langle J_1,\dots, J_{n-1} \rangle$,
where $\vec J_i$ corresponds to the right endpoint of $s_i$ (same as left endpoint of $s_{i+1}$.
A particular joint $\vec J_i$ is associated with a left segment $s_i$,
a right segment $s_{i+1}$, and a velocity $\vec J_v$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:joint_plane}
A joint plane is the plane that coincides with both segments $l$ and $r$ associated with a particular joint $J$.
In case the two segments are coincident (i.e. $\vec{\hat o}_l = \pm \vec{\hat o}_r$),
we define the joint plane to be orthogonal to $\vec{\hat v}_l = \vec{\hat v}_r$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:joint_plane_velocity}
Consider a joint $J$ associated with segments $l$, $r$, and joint plane $\mathcal P$,
where $\vec{\hat v}_l$ and $\vec{\hat v}_r$ are the velocities of segments $l$ and $r$.
We define $\vec{\hat v}_l^\shortparallel$ and $\vec{\hat v}_l^\perp$ as components of
$\vec{\hat v}_l$, such that $\vec{\hat v}_l^\shortparallel$ is the projection of $\vec{\hat v}_l$
onto $\mathcal P$, and $\vec{\hat v}_l^\perp = \vec{\hat v}_l - \vec{\hat v}_l^\shortparallel$
(orthogonal to $\mathcal P$).
Similarly, we define $\vec{\hat v}_r^\shortparallel$ and $\vec{\hat v}_r^\perp$, as the components of $\vec{\hat v}_r$.
By Invariant~\ref{inv:orthogonal_velocity}, $\vec{\hat v}_l^\shortparallel$ and $\vec{\hat v}_r^\shortparallel$
are orthogonal to $\vec{\hat o}_l$ and $\vec{\hat o}_r$ respectively.
This uniquely determines the direction of all velocity components.
\end{definition}

Henceforth, we will refer to the $\vec{\hat v}^\shortparallel$ component as the \emph{joint plane velocity},
and the $\vec{\hat v}^\perp$ component as the \emph{joint orthogonal velocity,}

\begin{restatable}{inv}{JointOrthogonalVelocity}
\label{inv:joint_orthogonal_velocity}
For a joint $J$ associated with segments $l$ and $r$, $\vec{\hat v}_l^\perp = \vec{\hat v}_r^\perp$
i.e. the joint orthogonal velocities have to be equal, such that the joint plane moves with a fixed velocity along it's normal.
As a corollary, $ \left\| \vec{\hat v}_l^\shortparallel\right\| = \left\| \vec{\hat v}_r^\shortparallel\right\|$.
\end{restatable}
