\begin{definition}
\label{def:compatible}
Given two cross section intervals $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal D$, such that $\mathcal C^F$ and $\mathcal D^I$ are equivalent,
we say that $\mathcal D$ is next-compatible with $\mathcal C$ and $\mathcal C$ is previous-compatible with $\mathcal D$.
Two cross sections $C = \langle s_1, s_2,\cdots s_n \rangle$ and $D = \langle r_1, r_2,\cdots r_m \rangle$ are equivalent
if and only if $C$ and $D$ correspond to the same sequence of segments after the deletion of all zero length segments.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{def:cross_section_sequence}
A cross section sequence is a sequence is an ordered list of cross section intervals $ \langle \mathcal C_1, \mathcal C_2,\cdots \mathcal C_n \rangle$,
such that $C_{i}$ is next-compatible with $C_{i-1}$ for all $i\in [n-1]$.
This is equivalent to stating that $C_{i}$ is previous-compatible with $C_{i+1}$ for all $i\in [n-1]$.
Note that we do not care about the directions of the segments.
\end{definition}

We will represent our full construction as a valid \emph{cross section sequence}.
Given a cross section sequence $\langle \mathcal C_1, \mathcal C_2,\cdots \mathcal C_n \rangle$,
the transition from $\mathcal C_i$ to $\mathcal C_{i+1}$ corresponds to the deletion of one or more
length zero segments from $\mathcal C_i$, and the addition of one or more zero length segments to obtain $\mathcal C_{i+1}$.
One simple example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:strip_narrowing}.
