\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The abstract must summarise the main content of the paper, and may be up to approximately 100 words in length. Unlike previous OSME publications, the abstract will be included in the proceedings. This abstract needs not be the same as that submitted for acceptance to the conference.

The equations are numbered, so they can be cross-referenced. Equation~\ref{eq:numbered} shows the cross-product of vector $\vec{r}$ with vector $\vec{F}$.
%
\begin{equation}
    \vec{M} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}
    \label{eq:numbered}
\end{equation}
%
The equation numbering is optional
%
\begin{equation*}
    \vec{M} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}
\end{equation*}
%
Equation~\ref{eq:two-align-one-number} has two aligned equations, but with a single equation number.
%
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vec{p} & = m\vec{v} \\
    \vec{H} & = \vec{I} \omega
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:two-align-one-number}  
\end{equation}
%
Alternatively, each equation has its own number (Equations~\ref{eq:two-align-two-number-first} and \ref{eq:two-align-two-number-second}).
%
\begin{align}
    \vec{F} & = \left[\begin{array}{c} F_x \\ F_y \end{array}\right] \label{eq:two-align-two-number-first}  \\
    \vec{F} & = m\vec{a} \label{eq:two-align-two-number-second}  
\end{align}

References to literature are handled using BibTeX. Sources can be cited individually \cite{SmithDoe2017} or multiple citations can be combined \cite{origami5,origami6}.

Figures should be high resolution bitmaps (300dpi or higher) or vector graphics. For photographs, use .jpg files; for line drawings or sketches use .png files or vector graphics such as .pdf. Using .jpg files for line drawings will make the lines blurry.
