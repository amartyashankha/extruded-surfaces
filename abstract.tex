\begin{abstract}
We introduce a new method of origami construction, using cross section diagrams.
Instead of beginning our construction from a 2-dimensional sheet of paper,
we consider a 1-dimensional cross section moving forwards in time.
We obtain conditions for the validity of a particular cross section evolution sequence,
and prove that the resulting folded state is \emph{isometric} to a flat sheet of paper.

Subsequently, we use this machinery to design an efficient construction of orthogonal terrains, with \emph{arbitrary rational extrusion heights}.
